# UnityP2P
Peer to peer networking in Unity using a free Heroku server for signaling.

Here's how to do it:

1. Make an account on https://www.heroku.com/. It is free and doesn't even require you to enter payment info
2. Go into https://dashboard.heroku.com and click New, then Create New App.
3. Pick some random app name or let it choose one for you it doesn't really matter because this is just the websocket url that no one will see
4. Install the [heroku cli](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)
5. Clone this repo, then copy the server code into a directory without the .git file
